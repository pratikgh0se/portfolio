                Led a monumental initiative to migrate Highspot's legacy observability systems from GCP/GKE to AWS and optimize metric collection, logging, and alerting. This project resulted in significant cost savings, improved system health visibility, and streamlined incident management.

                <h3>Key Technologies & Tools</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, OpenTelemetry, Fluent Bit, Fluentd, Thanos, Elasticsearch, Rollbar, AWS (EKS, Lambda, Firehose, CloudWatch, S3), GCP (GKE), Terraform, Go, Python, Bash, Google App Scripts, OpsGenie, Jira, GitHub Actions.</p>

                <h3>Situation</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Highspot's observability infrastructure was a complex, fragmented landscape spanning multiple legacy tools (Prometheus v2, Thanos for long-term storage, self-hosted Grafana instances, Elasticsearch for logs, Rollbar for error tracking) and cloud providers (GCP/GKE and AWS). This multi-vendor, multi-cloud sprawl led to exorbitant operational costs (daily metric ingestion ~20TB, monthly storage ~256TB), inconsistent monitoring dashboards, severe alert fatigue due to duplicate or unactionable alerts, and prolonged Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for incidents because critical data was scattered across disparate systems, making debugging a "war room" scenario.

                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Consolidate and optimize Highspot's observability stack by executing a comprehensive migration to a unified New Relic platform. This involved deprecating all legacy systems and implementing robust, cost-efficient metric and log management strategies to drastically reduce operational costs, enhance system reliability, and significantly improve incident response capabilities.

                    <li>Reconfigured Fluent Bit (for Kubernetes pods) and Fluentd (for EC2 instances) to directly forward logs to New Relic, eliminating intermediate aggregators.</li>
                    <li>Implemented distributed tracing and spans with the New Relic Java Agent in Magma, conducting POCs for custom tracing and debugging uninstrumented time.</li>
                    <li>Orchestrated regional AWS CloudWatch metrics and log streaming to New Relic using Terraform, AWS Kinesis Firehose, and AWS Lambda, ensuring data locality and compliance.</li>
                    <li>Developed Golang scripts and Google App Scripts (.gs) to automate the analysis and identification of high-cardinality and unused metrics.</li>
                    <li>Proposed and successfully implemented a "Crew Ownership and Metrics Budgeting" model, assigning clear ownership of metrics to specific engineering teams.</li>
                    <li>Designed a sophisticated metrics aggregation solution using a custom Kubernetes controller and CRDs.</li>
                    <li>Established a robust, version-controlled alert creation and governance process by integrating OpsGenie and Jira with Terraform scripts, utilizing GitHub Actions for automated validation.</li>
                    <li>Automated alert validation processes across New Relic, Slack, and PagerDuty.</li>
                    <li>Automated observability workflows using Terraform for critical tasks like alert creation, resource cleanup, and Kubernetes cluster backups.</li>
                    <li>Authored comprehensive internal playbooks for tool deprecations and migrations, created detailed design documents, and conducted extensive training sessions.</li>
                    <li>Mentored teammates (Pankaj, Krishna, Venu) on complex Terraform and Kustomize configurations.</li>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This was a highly complex, multi-faceted, and ultimately monumental transformation of Highspot's observability landscape. My leadership in driving this initiative, coupled with deep technical expertise in cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), Kubernetes, and a wide array of observability tools, was absolutely critical to its success. The project delivered massive, quantifiable cost savings while simultaneously improving system reliability, operational agility, and the overall developer experience. The strategic implementation of metric ownership, automated governance processes, and robust data pipelines ensures long-term sustainability and positions Highspot for continuous improvement in its operational capabilities. This project truly showcased my ability to lead large-scale technical migrations with a focus on both immediate impact and long-term strategic value.
