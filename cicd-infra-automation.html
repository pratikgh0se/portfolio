                <h3>Situation</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    At EPAM Systems, many projects were experiencing inefficiencies and delays in their software delivery lifecycle. Application deployment and infrastructure provisioning were often manual, repetitive, and consequently, error-prone processes. This reliance on manual intervention led to inconsistent environments, prolonged release cycles, and a significant drain on developer and operations team time, hindering the ability to deliver software rapidly and reliably.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    My primary task as a Junior Software Engineer was to contribute to the modernization of the software delivery process. This involved designing and implementing end-to-end CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure provisioning using Python scripting and Terraform, and contributing to the development of reusable, scalable infrastructure management practices within a Microsoft Azure cloud environment.

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    My work at EPAM Systems provided me with a strong foundational understanding of core DevOps principles, including continuous integration/continuous delivery, containerization, and Infrastructure as Code. The hands-on experience with key technologies like Docker, Jenkins, Microsoft Azure, Python automation, and Terraform was invaluable for my early career development. The projects I contributed to showcased my ability to identify manual pain points and develop automated solutions that delivered tangible benefits in terms of speed, efficiency, and reliability. This role was crucial in building my initial expertise in cloud infrastructure and automation, setting the stage for more advanced roles.
