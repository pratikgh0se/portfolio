                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    ThoughtSpot operates a complex, multi-tenant SaaS platform with customer clusters deployed across both GCP and AWS. A significant challenge was the lack of a unified and real-time logging solution across these diverse environments. Logs were scattered, difficult to access centrally, and not consistently enriched with critical metadata. This fragmentation made it extremely difficult to quickly diagnose tenant-specific issues, monitor Service Level Agreements (SLAs) effectively, and detect incidents proactively, leading to prolonged debugging cycles and reactive incident response.

                <h3>Action</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Designed a comprehensive, cloud-neutral architecture for real-time log streaming from all tenant clusters, abstracting away cloud-specific logging mechanisms.</li>
                    <li>Configured Fluent Bit DaemonSets for Kubernetes (GCP/AWS EKS) and Fluentd agents for EC2 instances to efficiently collect logs, ensuring logs were enriched with critical metadata.</li>
                    <li>Established high-throughput pipelines to stream all collected logs in real-time to Elasticsearch, optimizing indexing strategies, and configured Kibana dashboards for immediate search and analysis.</li>
                    <li>Implemented proactive alerts based on specific log patterns (e.g., high error rates, critical application events) and enabled monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) by analyzing log data.</li>
                    <li>Designed the entire logging pipeline to be highly scalable and resilient, capable of handling petabytes of log data from numerous tenant clusters.</li>
                    <li>Utilized Terraform extensively to define and deploy the entire log streaming infrastructure, ensuring consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled deployments.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated closely with SRE, development, and customer support teams to understand logging needs and trained teams on effectively using Kibana for debugging, RCA, and proactive monitoring.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Successfully implemented a robust, cloud-neutral, real-time tenant log streaming architecture.</li>
                    <li>Provided centralized, real-time visibility into all tenant logs in Kibana.</li>
                    <li>Significantly improved the ability to detect incidents proactively (reducing detection time by an estimated <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">40%</span>).</li>
                    <li>Monitored tenant-specific SLAs with greater accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Debugging cycles were drastically reduced (by approximately <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">30%</span>).</li>
                    <li>Operational teams gained unprecedented insight into system behavior across the multi-tenant environment, leading to faster issue resolution and improved customer experience.</li>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This was a highly impactful and transformative project that directly addressed critical business objectives: improving customer satisfaction and enhancing operational efficiency. My leadership in driving the proactive bug hunt, combined with deep technical skills in observability (Grafana, Kibana, Prometheus, Telegraf), Kubernetes automation (CRDs, Operators), and cutting-edge AI/ML (RAG for Pharos), was absolutely critical. The ability to collaborate effectively across multiple engineering teams and translate complex technical insights into actionable cost savings demonstrated strong business acumen and a holistic understanding of the platform. The successful development and deployment of Pharos showcased significant innovation in leveraging AI for complex operational challenges, setting a new standard for incident management at ThoughtSpot.
