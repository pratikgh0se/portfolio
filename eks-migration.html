                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Highspot's core services were deployed across a mix of disparate and legacy infrastructure, including various Kubernetes platforms and older container orchestration systems. This created significant limitations in achieving consistent dynamic scalability, ensuring uniform reliability, and incurred high operational overhead due to fragmented management and maintenance across different cloud providers (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS). The lack of a unified, modern approach hindered rapid development and efficient resource utilization, creating bottlenecks for growth in a multi-cloud landscape.

                <h3>Action</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Developed meticulous migration strategies for transitioning services between different Kubernetes platforms (e.g., to Amazon EKS, and conceptualizing/planning for Azure AKS integrations).</li>
                    <li>Utilized Terraform to provision and manage Kubernetes clusters (EKS, and defining patterns for AKS) in a declarative manner, focusing on cluster setup, worker node groups, and core service configurations.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated closely with various development teams to containerize and optimize core services for various Kubernetes environments.</li>
                    <li>Integrated deployment processes into existing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using Buildkite for builds and tests, and ArgoCD for declarative Kubernetes deployments) for consistent and automated rollouts across different K8s platforms.</li>
                    <li>Implemented stringent security configurations within Kubernetes clusters, including fine-grained AWS IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts (IRSA for EKS) and integrating with External Secrets Operator (ESO) for secure secret management across cloud boundaries.</li>
                    <li>Ensured seamless integration with unified observability stacks (Prometheus-Operator for metrics, New Relic for metrics, logs, and traces) to provide comprehensive, real-time monitoring of cluster health and application performance across multi-cloud K8s deployments.</li>
                    <li>Actively debugged complex deployment issues and optimized resource allocation (CPU and memory limits) for pods across diverse Kubernetes environments to achieve optimal performance, stability, and cost efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Successfully directed the migration and optimization of critical core services to modern Kubernetes platforms (like Amazon EKS), demonstrating capabilities in managing multi-cloud containerized environments.</li>
                    <li>This resulted in significantly enhanced scalability and improved reliability across diverse cloud footprints.</li>
                    <li>The transition reduced operational overhead by automating infrastructure provisioning and streamlining cluster management, leading to improved resource utilization and tangible cost efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The established multi-cloud Kubernetes foundation provides a resilient and agile base for future service development and innovation.</li>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This project demonstrated senior-level capabilities in architecture, planning, and execution within complex multi-cloud Kubernetes environments. My leadership in driving infrastructure transitions and optimizing core services across platforms like EKS (and understanding the patterns for AKS) was crucial. The project not only modernized Highspot's core services but also laid a robust foundation for future growth and operational excellence in a multi-cloud strategy.
