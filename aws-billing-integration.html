                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Highspot incurred significant and growing cloud costs from its extensive use of AWS services. However, there was a critical lack of granular visibility and attribution regarding how specific services, individual teams, or distinct projects contributed to the overall expenditure. This opaque cost structure made it extremely difficult to identify inefficiencies, accurately attribute costs to business units, or make informed, data-driven decisions for effective cost optimization. Business leaders and engineering managers were often flying blind regarding their cloud spend.

                <h3>Action</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Meticulously identified and configured the most relevant AWS billing data sources, primarily setting up AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) to be delivered regularly to a designated S3 bucket, and exploring/integrating with the AWS Cost Explorer API.</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented a robust and scalable data pipeline to efficiently ingest the voluminous AWS billing data, leveraging AWS Lambda functions triggered by S3 events and AWS Kinesis Firehose.</li>
                    <li>Developed sophisticated processes to transform the raw, complex billing data into an actionable format, including parsing intricate CUR files and enriching data with internal metadata by applying strategic tagging strategies.</li>
                    <li>Created intuitive and comprehensive dashboards and reports, primarily leveraging tools like New Relic custom events/metrics and integrating with a dedicated business intelligence platform or data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake) for deeper financial analysis.</li>
                    <li>Performed ongoing, in-depth analysis of the integrated billing data, deriving actionable insights for cost-saving opportunities, such as rightsizing underutilized EC2 instances, optimizing storage tiers, and identifying idle or orphaned resources.</li>
                    <li>Presented these actionable recommendations to engineering teams, finance departments, and leadership, facilitating data-driven discussions and decisions on cloud cost optimization initiatives.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>The integration of AWS billing data provided unprecedented, granular visibility into AWS usage patterns and associated costs across Highspot.</li>
                    <li>This critical transparency enabled the organization to make informed, data-driven cost-saving decisions, directly leading to optimized cloud spending and improved resource efficiency across the entire AWS footprint.</li>
                    <li>The initiative significantly improved financial transparency and accountability for cloud resource consumption among various teams, fostering a culture of cost awareness and responsible cloud usage.</li>

                    This project provided critical transparency and enabled significant cost optimization for Highspot. My ability to design and implement robust data pipelines, perform in-depth data analysis, and translate complex financial insights into actionable recommendations demonstrated strong data engineering, analytical thinking, and business acumen. This initiative directly addressed a major business pain point related to cloud expenditure, showcasing my strategic value beyond technical execution.
