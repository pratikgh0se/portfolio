                Designed and implemented cross-cloud Terraform infrastructure for observability, supporting AWS and GCP environments. Built a Terraform controller in Go and integrated it with ArgoCD for Kubernetes data plane automation.

                <h3>Key Technologies & Tools</h3>

                <h3>Situation</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    ThoughtSpot operated a complex, multi-cloud environment, with critical services deployed across both AWS and GCP. The observability infrastructure (including monitoring, alerting, and logging components) for these environments was often provisioned and managed manually or through disparate, non-standardized scripts. This fragmented approach led to significant inconsistencies in configurations, frequent configuration drift, increased human errors during setup, and substantial delays in bringing new Kubernetes data planes online with proper monitoring capabilities. The lack of automation was a major bottleneck for scaling operations.

                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Automate the end-to-end deployment and ongoing management of observability infrastructure across both AWS and GCP using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). Furthermore, the task involved building a Kubernetes-native controller in Go and integrating it with ArgoCD to enable GitOps-driven automation for provisioning observability components on new Kubernetes data planes.

            </div>

            <div class="detail-section">
                <h3>Action</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Meticulously authored modular, reusable, and cloud-agnostic Terraform modules for common observability components (Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit, New Relic agents) adaptable to both AWS and GCP.</li>
                    <li>Designed and developed a custom Kubernetes controller from scratch in Go, including defining Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and implementing controller logic with the Kubernetes client-go library.</li>
                    <li>Integrated the controller to interact directly with the Terraform CLI, dynamically generating and executing Terraform configurations upon detecting changes in ObservabilityConfig CRDs.</li>
                    <li>Implemented robust mechanisms for managing Terraform state securely and comprehensive error reporting.</li>
                    <li>Configured ArgoCD to manage the deployment of the custom Go Terraform controller itself, ensuring its lifecycle was managed declaratively.</li>
                    <li>Designed the controller to be triggered by ArgoCD events or Git repository changes, ensuring new Kubernetes clusters automatically had their observability infrastructure set up.</li>
                    <li>Established and maintained robust CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins and GitHub Actions) to lint/validate Terraform, build/test the Go controller, and deploy it.</li>
                    <li>Conducted extensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure reliability and correctness of the automation.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <li>Successfully automated the end-to-end deployment and ongoing management of observability infrastructure across ThoughtSpot's complex multi-cloud footprint.</li>
                    <li>The Go Terraform controller, tightly integrated with ArgoCD, enabled a true GitOps approach for observability.</li>
                    <li>Drastically reduced manual effort by <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">over 70%</span>.</li>
                    <li>Improved configuration consistency by <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">90%</span>.</li>
                    <li>Accelerated the onboarding of new Kubernetes data planes by <span class="font-semibold text-blue-600">50%</span> with pre-configured monitoring and logging.</li>
                    <li>Led to a more reliable and efficient operational environment.</li>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This initiative represented a significant leap forward in ThoughtSpot's infrastructure automation maturity and operational efficiency. My strong command of Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, deep expertise in Go for Kubernetes controller development, and a clear understanding of GitOps principles were instrumental in the project's success. The solution not only solved immediate pain points related to manual configuration and inconsistency but also laid a scalable and resilient foundation for future observability needs across diverse cloud environments. The technical depth required to build and integrate such a system was considerable, and its successful implementation demonstrated strong system design, automation, and problem-solving skills.
